# RoboticRestaurantsEnglish3302

     For Christmas this year, my girlfriend is getting me a Vitamix blender. In case you don’t know, Vitamix is a top-of-the-line brand known for being extremely durable and long-lasting – I absolutely hate unnecessary waste, and thus try to buy things known to last a long time. 

     Every so often though, I come across a moment of doubt – why do I need a Vitamix? I have a fantastic food processor and great knife skills already; the blender will only create a slightly different product than what’s already in my arsenal of tools. The food processor can blend potentially 75% as smooth. But why do I need a food processor if I have a knife? The knife can mince, with a generous estimate, maybe 50% as smooth as a food processor. Why not use my hands? The list goes on and on…

     I’m Sebastian. I’ve spent a long time working in just about any role you could think of in commercial kitchens, and even longer exploring the expansive world of cooking in a home kitchen. Make no mistake, I am not a chef, but I consider myself a skillful cook. Recently, I’ve also worked almost two years between two drastically different companies as a software engineer and see many interesting problems in the intersection of the two disciplines. For instance, how can we leverage new tools and technologies to improve the restaurant industry and create new concepts to excite people about the future of the food we eat.

     The collaboration between humans and tools is completely necessary in the restaurant industry. Unless you only work with raw, ready-to-eat ingredients, you need to rely on more than your hands to cook. If your competitor uses a Vitamix to make smoothies, you are unlikely to attract guests if you are using inferior tools like a food processor or a knife. Look inside any modern commercial kitchen (or restaurant supply store) and it is amazing seeing the breadth of the tools have been developed to assist the cooking process. There are things as simple as spoon holders and as complex as multi-channel cooking ranges or even the multiple printers scattered throughout the cooking areas. The engineering logic behind many of these can be quite complicated. In fact, there is a popular system design interview question for software engineers – design a coffee maker. As the caffeine machines get more and more advanced, I run the risk of not finding employment :]. 

     When is a tool more than just a tool, when is does it turn robotic? A “tool” I use often is my Joule sous-vide that connects to my phone over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Once I set it, it remembers what I want in its miniscule local memory, and I am free to do anything else while it keeps a water bath at the perfect temperature until it is finished cooking, and then it will shut off automagically. This device does something that is impossible by humans, just as a human cannot effectively cut an onion unless they use a tool. While lines might be blurred if my Joule is a tool or a robot, would it be a robot if it were to handle a fryer instead?

     Humans must work with tools in a restaurant, but in recent times we are now seeing much more proliferation of robots in restaurants. This is the next stage of productivity in a restaurant – human-robot collaboration, which is what I would like to highlight examples of in this blog post. While there is still more development to be done to create more efficient tools (non-automated, like blenders, printers, cooking ranges), I will be focusing on the new era of increasing restaurant productivity - robots. I will explore a few examples, and finish with a few things we must keep in mind as we go forward with the next step of the restaurant industry.

# Front of house
     When you walk into a restaurant, you start making judgements immediately. A well-refined restaurant knows this and plays into it. Some restaurants are also redefining what we expect, to differentiate themselves and grow their customer base.

## Ordering Kiosks
     McDonald’s is known throughout the world for its quick, easy, and consistent food options, and they were also one of the first major restaurant brands to implement ordering kiosks. In the journal article “Automation of the fast-food industry: Gen-Z perspectives of self-service kiosks versus employee service” we find that using these “robots” or “tools” (the ordering kiosks) provide a space for guests who are unsure of what they want to peruse the menu, check ingredients and nutrition information, and collaborate with others while taking their order, which is extremely preferable to the Gen-Z participants surveyed. This then leads fewer people to the employee-service counter which speeds up service for everybody. The workers can in-turn assist a station that could now appreciate the extra help for the incoming orders. In addition, multiple people or groups of people can order in parallel at the different kiosks, regardless of how many employees at their point-of-sale system. 

     Also mentioned by the article is the ability for guests who are not as comfortable speaking in the language of the country they are in, is the ability to translate via a button on the ordering kiosk. They can also take time to understand what they are ordering if that isn’t an option. By providing this feature, you are making the guest feel welcome and included, which will keep them coming back. 

     To create an excellent customer experience, you must know what your customer wants and adapt to them. Self-service kiosks are desirable to Gen-Z, and their practicality can be appreciated by many more groups of people.



## Self-service, a step further
     One of my girlfriend and I’s favorite restaurants to eat at when I’m back in my hometown of San Antonio, Texas is Kura Revolving Sushi Bar, a popular chain of conveyer-belt sushi. It is not the best sushi I’ve ever had, but it’s still fantastic, and has a fascinating layout. A human host leads you to your seats. You place your drink order on a tablet screen which is in front of every single seat (as well as a large conveyer belt which wraps around the entire restaurant) and a robot navigates the crowded sushi bar and brings it straight to where you are sitting, with fun, upbeat music playing. As for the food, the conveyer belt right in front of you has many unique options from sliced watermelon to rainbow rolls, to cheesecake. If you want something that is out of stock by the time it reaches you, or something different altogether, you can place an order for it on the tablet screen in front of you which has well documented pictures and ingredients lists, and it comes straight out to where you are sitting on a second, elevated conveyer belt that spans each row of seats. When you finish a plate, you deposit it into a plate slot right in front of you which tracks how many plates you have ordered, and charges you accordingly. Turn your head 90 degrees, and you can see a line of diligently working sushi chefs in the back keeping up with the intensely busy restaurant’s conveyer belt and custom orders.

     Clearly, in addition to the on-demand food options, there is something to be said about the entertainment value of the system itself. Every time we go, there are tons of families. In the peer-reviewed article “Understanding the robotic restaurant experience: A multiple case study” through an analysis of TripAdvisor reviews, we find that a large number of people come to these restaurants to entertain children, or for the entertainment value of the robots themselves. I am somewhat disinterested in robotics, yet the robot assistance at Kura is extremely fascinating and adds a fun element to a nice dinner.

## Drive-Through Automation
     Returning to our fast-food example, you will find the drive-through speaker. Ordering from a drive through can feel tedious, due to the nature of it. Sitting at a drive-through speaker and telling your order item-by-item to the kitchen involves many pauses, especially for large orders, as the order-taker navigates a complicated graphical user interface to look for each item. If there is any customization added to the items, searching for each modification only increases the time to find the button needed to signal this on the ticket that is sent to the cooks. This is also in addition to the latency incurred by sending the audio data through the network or radio waves and playing it through a speaker. 

     Certain restaurants are leveraging artificial intelligence to make this process more seamless, such as fast-food chains like Del Taco, as mentioned in _The AI will now take your taco order_ published on Bloomberg.com. Presto Automation is partnering with multiple restaurant chains to improve the drive-through ordering experience. As demonstrated, it speeds up the process, the computer processing speech can then add items to the order in a matter of milliseconds. While it is not demonstrated in the video, I wonder how the AI would behave if you ordered a list of items without pauses, as long as you were explicit about what you want. That could be an incredible time saver especially compared to walk-in kiosks, or clunky mobile apps. A tool like this can create a ton of customer satisfaction and could transition order-taking personnel into more of a hospitality-based role to further create loyal customers. That being said, there will still be a need for order takers, as the machine diverts food allergy questions to real people, which is understandable. Speed aside, the AI order takers being trained to upsell will bring in more revenue to the restaurant, providing more room for restaurant improvements and raised wages.

# Back-of-house
     Jeremy Allen White in the series The Bear does a fantastic job representing the stress and pressure in the kitchen. As a chef in charge of running the family’s sandwich shop, he is tasked with getting the restaurant back to profitability, while dealing with massive business debt, flaky employees, and many other small-business realities that have unforgiving room for error. What goes on behind the counter can be hectic in slow times and beyond chaotic when it’s busy. Some robots have been created to assist with that. 

## Fryer robot
     Miso Robotics has developed “Flippy” a robot that can manage multiple different items in a fryer station. According to an article published in Today.com titled _White Castle is rolling out fry cook robots across the US_, updated as recently as October 2023, White Castle is implementing these robots to manage their fryer stations at 100 restaurants. So far 17 robots have been installed, and they are seeing increases in quality and consistency of the fried products. 

     Pessimists, rest assured, jobs are safe, for now. From what I have gathered from my time in restaurants, as well as networking with people around the industry, the fryers rarely have a dedicated employee at this class and quality of fast-food restaurant. It is the duty of people in other positions in the restaurant to own the position on top of their expected duties. When restaurants are running as lean as possible, this doesn’t save enough labor to make somebody redundant and thus Flippy shouldn’t be an issue for job replacement.


## Cooking Robot
     Spyce, as mentioned in “Understanding the robotic experience” is another fascinating example with a similar situation as the previous example. A key difference is that it opened as a robot restaurant, and not downsized using robots. At Spyce in Boston, MA, humans prepare foods like vegetables and proteins and pass them to an active stir-frying robot in a visible kitchen, all for the guests to watch. A human then passes the bowl of food back to the guest once it is finished cooking. By using robots for some of the process, they were able to limit the prices to be slightly under $8 per bowl. This example is more robot dominant which makes it unique and gives it strong entertainment value. New concepts in the restaurant world like Spyce are exciting and hopefully we see more competitors to them in the coming years.

# Going Forward
     Robots are starting to gain headwind in the restaurant industry and provide for a novel way to provide value to restaurant patrons. Some of the concerns we need to keep in mind going forward are its standards for health and cleanliness and its ability to effectively do the job. Let’s examine these issues.

## Health and cleanliness
     The age-old situation of a guest finding a hair in their food is a valid concern when staffing humans in food-handling positions, but when staffing robots on these positions, the concern becomes a bit more profound. A major concern I have with robots is that they have many small parts. If a screw were to fall into a guest’s food, that opens the restaurant to a major liability risk, and an unpleasant experience for the guest. A major advantage to Flippy’s design is that the employee must package the output, and intentional or not, gives a human the opportunity to inspect it before giving it to the guest. Spyce as well is designed in such a way that the chances of a foreign object unintentionally landing in someone’s food are nearly impossible, although it does not get a final inspection.

     This does not over the potential issues in automated cooking. Allergens, cross-contamination, and temperature fail-safes are design decisions needed when engineering these robots to ensure robotic kitchens will be safe and accessible. 

## Effectiveness
     Robots could theoretically do everything, but how effective would they be? Kitchens are not charities for robot companies, profit margins are normally tight, so restaurants cannot afford to work with robots that don’t get the job done effectively, or ones that humans do not want to collaborate with.

     With the emergence of any technology, there always has been and always will be people separated into four groups: embracers, supporters, resistors, and saboteurs as documented in “My colleague is a robot” and with the goal of using human-robot interaction to improve customer satisfaction, we must keep that in mind. Some employees will use the technology and love it, and some may ignore it or even try to disable it. It’s important to understand why an employee would want to disable it. They could be acting maliciously, or they may find that the robot does not help productivity even after the initial collaboration learning curve. In this situation, you need to reflect on the process and whether automation will speed it up, or if it’s better done manually for now. Restaurant robots will simply fail to grow if they don’t work effectively, and if we don’t listen to our saboteurs and resistors.

# Closing Thoughts
     The industry is changing at an alarming rate. While traditional full-service restaurants have stayed very similar over time, new concepts and fast-food restaurants are entering a period of rapid change. Even restaurant mobile applications are starting to grow as businesses see them as a new channel for customer growth. The industry’s adoption of technology is something I would recommend to people in the restaurant career to get familiar with. I strongly believe we can harness these developments to create a golden age for new concepts, and revolutionize the old ones as well, much like how my Vitamix can revolutionize what was previously possible with food processors and knives.
